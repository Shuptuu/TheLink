Unfortunately, since the covid, I’m not able to work for free anymore...
So TheLink comes now in a demo version, fully functional but with pop-up messages every 5 minutes asking for a donation.
There’s no minimum amount, it all helps!  \
If paypal doesn't support donations through this system in your country, you can use this link: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/TheLinkOlivier  \
Once done, you will receive a license key which will stop pop-up messages appearing in future.  \
The license key is personnal but with a permanent validity and can be use on several computers.  \
I will need your email address to send you the key. So please make sure your address is visible in your paypal profil or send me a private message.

## Presentation
TheLink is a Windows software dedicated for Behringer X-Touch Mini USB Midi Controller,
“adding” midi remote control capabilities to X AIR Edit / M AIR Edit softwares in order to you to
control digital mixers XR12, XR16, X18, XR18 from Behringer and MR12, MR18 from Midas,
through the local network (Ethernet or Wifi), using your X-Touch Mini device.  

It literally makes the link between X-Touch Mini, AIR Edit and your digital mixer.

close TheLink.

Buses, FXs, FX Taps (for delay and chorus), Mute Groups, DCAs Tabs

resizable and you can choose between 2 types (bar or panel) to match you monitor size.
- Bi-directional synchronization with AIR Edit: selections on X-Touch Mini are reflected on AIR Edit.
Selections in AIR Edit are also reflected on X-Touch Mini. So you’re never lost or confused.
- Overlay provided

## Quickstart
- Download the zip file on your computer and decompress it.
- The .exe file you get is not an installer, it’s directly the app.
- Use the 64 bit version as a priority to avoid any antivirus problems (see below).
- Copy the .exe file where you want on your computer, preferably where X-AIR edit or M-AIR edit is
located (so TheLink will be able to start it automatically for you).
- Make sure your X-Touch Mini controller is connected to your computer, in Mackie Control mode
and not used by any app.
- Make sure you can acces your digital mixer through your local network (Ethernet or Wifi)
- Double-click the app to launch TheLink. If X-AIR edit or M-AIR edit is in the same folder, TheLink will
launch it for you. Otherwise, you have to start manually X-AIR edit or M-AIR edit before launching
TheLink.
- Now, follow on with X-AIR edit or M-AIR edit to connect to your digital mixer. There’s nothing else to
do for TheLink, just enjoy!
